## Tapping Term Explained

The **Tapping Term** is a crucial part of this layout that defines the behavior of each key based on how long it is pressed. Here's a breakdown of the various tapping terms used:

- **Hold:** 135ms - This includes _Auto-Shift_ for letters and _Hold_ actions for symbols
- **Double-Tap:** 200ms - This gives extra time to hit the key again, preventing a hold action by mistake

<!-- 0/14 -->

## Caps WORD Key

This key streamlines the typing of capitalized words without locking the entire keyboard in caps mode. Here's how it works:

- **Activate**: Tap before typing your next word.
- **Behavior**: The immediately following word will be automatically typed in ALL CAPS.
- **Deactivate**: This mode will automatically turn off after the word is completed, signaled by pressing Space, an arrow key, or after a five-second pause.

<!-- 0/21 -->

## Arrow Keys Placement Explained

The arrow keys have been intentionally placed on the main layer. This decision stems from a deep understanding of coding practices and the frequent need to navigate text:

- **Vertical**: Mirroring the natural **up-down** motion, these are Aligned in a way that reflects their vertical navigation purpose.

- **Horizontal**: Mirroring the natural **left-right** motion, these are situated in spots that intuitively correspond to their function.

<!-- 0/28 -->

## Retaining Essential Modifiers

While these keys may not be in constant use for day-to-day typing, their utility in performing specific, often crucial, tasks cannot be overstated. Here's some reasons why:

- **Shift**: Shortcuts, Contiguous Selection.
- **Control**: Shortcuts, Random Selection.
- **Alt**: The Alt key can be vital for efficient workflow within various software environments.
- **Windows**: Start Menu, Virtual Desktops & Window Swapping, Snapping Windows.

## Ergonomic Thumb Zone: Spacing Keys

These keys—**Space**, **Backspace**, **Enter**, and **Delete**—are strategically positioned on the thumb cluster. This design choice is rooted in the goal of maximizing typing efficiency and ergonomic comfort.

By allocating spacing functions to the thumbs, the most agile digits, we minimize movement and increase typing speed. This setup allows the other fingers to remain focused on letter and command keys without frequent repositioning.

<!-- 0/20 -->

## Special Layer: Numerical and Coding Efficiency

Switch between the main layout and a layer with a numpad and VS Code-specific keys. Use it two ways:

- **Hold & Release**: Temporarily access the special layer for quick tasks, then return to the main layout.
- **Tap to Toggle**: Locks the layer for extended use, tap again to return.

<!-- 1/33 -->

## Thumb Keys: Maintaining Transparency

On the special layer, all thumb keys—**Space**, **Backspace**, **Enter**, and **Delete**—remain unchanged from the main layout, ensuring consistent access to essential spacing functions. This "transparent" approach allows for uninterrupted typing and command execution, even while using the numpad, enhancing usability and ergonomic flow.

<!-- 1/63 -->

**Dedicated Number Pad**: Features digits 0-9, optimized for efficiency without the need for a NumLock toggle. Each key retains its numeric value, simplifying input and eliminating the traditional toggle mechanism. This ensures immediate access to numbers, streamlining data entry and calculations.

<!-- 1/64 -->

**Standard Symbol Access**: The special layer also integrates direct access to basic symbols, positioning them for intuitive use. These are found on your traditional number pad, and arranged ergonomically, eliminating the need for complex shortcuts.

<!-- 1/66 -->

**Double-Chevron Keys for C++**: Focused on enhancing the coding experience for C++ developers, our special layer includes dedicated keys for double-chevrons (`<<`, `>>`). These symbols, crucial for bit shifting, insertion, and extraction operations, are now directly accessible. This design choice streamlines the process of writing C++ code, allowing for quicker and more efficient coding by reducing the keystrokes needed for these common operations.

<!-- 1/36 -->

**Hexadecimal Input Enhancement**: Recognizing the frequent need for hexadecimal notation in programming and networking contexts, such as color codes, MAC addresses, and IPv6 addresses, the letters a-f have been added alongside the 0-9 digits on the number pad. This arrangement significantly streamlines the input of hexadecimal values, eliminating the need to switch layers or layouts for such entries. By integrating these letters, users can effortlessly type hexadecimal codes, enhancing efficiency in tasks requiring precise color specifications or addressing.

<!-- 1/38 -->

**Pound Symbol for Color Codes**: To facilitate the easy writing of color codes, the numpad features the pound symbol (`#`), a staple in defining colors in web development and design. This addition ensures that when specifying colors in hexadecimal format, the initial `#` can be entered quickly and seamlessly, directly from the numpad. This enhancement streamlines the process of color coding, making it more intuitive and efficient for developers and designers alike.

<!-- 1/39 -->

**Colon for Efficient Addressing**: Recognizing the necessity of the colon (`:`) in formatting MAC addresses, IPv6 addresses, and time-related inputs, it has been thoughtfully added to the numpad. This ensures that tasks requiring address inputs or time specifications can be executed with greater speed and less interruption, streamlining networking tasks and programming workflows where such notation is commonplace.

<!-- 1/40 -->

**Dollar Sign for Financials**: The addition of the dollar sign (`$`) to the numpad caters to the frequent need to denote monetary values in various applications. This symbol is essential for financial documents, coding economic models, or any task requiring quick access to currency notation.

<!-- 1/41 -->

**Percent Sign for Calculations**: The percent sign (`%`) is a versatile addition to the numpad, serving dual purposes. It's indispensable for indicating percentages in financial calculations, reports, and data analysis. Additionally, in programming, it acts as the modulus operator, a fundamental tool in languages like C, Java, and Python for obtaining the remainder of division operations. This key ensures quick access for both mathematical expressions and coding tasks, streamlining workflows that require frequent percentage calculations or modulus operations.

<!-- 1/48 -->

**Brackets for Precise Calculations**: To support accurate and efficient mathematical notation, open (`(`) and close (`)`) brackets have been added to the numpad. These are crucial for denoting calculation order in expressions following the BEDMAS (Brackets, Exponents, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) principle. This addition facilitates the quick input of complex calculations in fields such as mathematics, engineering, and software development, where the clarity of operation order is essential for correct results.

<!-- 1/42 -->

Finally, the all-important (`Reset`) key. This key reboots your keyboard into the bootloader, which allows you to flash new firmware.

It's the same thing that happens when you stick a paperclip in the little hole in the top-left corner, only you don't need a paperclip.
